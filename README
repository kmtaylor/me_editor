A software editor for the Boss ME-5.

To build:

Requirements:
 - Jack Audio Connection Kit
 - glib (part of the gtk project)
 - flex and bison
 - gcc and make

The usual build commands:

autoreconf --install (Use this if you don't have a configure script yet)
./configure
make
make install

This will build:
me_explorer	- Patch editing, loading and unloading. You will probably want
		  to customise sysex_explorer.h to meet your needs. In
		  particular, you'll need to set PATCHDIR to something useful.
		  (This is the location where saved patches are written to/
		  read from).
		  Another file location #define is LOGFILE in log.h
Use:
To use each programme, the Jack daemon must be running and a midi connection
must be made between each application and the Juno.
